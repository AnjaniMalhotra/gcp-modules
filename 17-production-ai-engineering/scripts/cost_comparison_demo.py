"""Topic 10 - Cost Optimization.

1) Sends the same moderation prompt through Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro,
   printing real token counts and an estimated cost for each.
2) Replays a small batch of requests (half duplicates) against a running
   ModeraAI instance and reads /stats before and after, to prove caching
   reduced the number of REAL Gemini calls below the number of incoming
   requests.

Prices below are illustrative per-1K-token estimates for teaching purposes -
always check the current Vertex AI pricing page before quoting a real number
to students. The model IDs below are also worth re-checking at build time -
Gemini model IDs retire on a schedule (gemini-2.0-flash-001 was discontinued
June 1, 2026; there was never a stable "gemini-2.0-pro-001" GA release at
all - Gemini 2.0 Pro only ever shipped as an experimental preview). Check
https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini
for the current GA lineup before recording this module.
